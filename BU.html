      <h3>Bournemouth University Support</h3>
      
      In partial response to a letter one of our volunteers received from the Director of Student Services of Bournemouth University we feel we need to give the following clarification regarding our relationship with BU.<br><br>
      
      Some of our volunteers are students and/or staff of BU. However, there is no contractual relationship with BU to provide mental health and neurodiversity support services. Our groups are also open to students of other educational establishments and non-students alike.<br><br>
      
      The Director of Student Services has informed us that BU has a well equipped <a href="https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/students/health-wellbeing/health-wellbeing-services/student-wellbeing-service">Student Wellbeing Service</a> and we would refer BU students to this for professional assistance. Our groups offer chat cafe styled peer support.<br><br>
      
      BU does not support our group in an official capacity. However, we are appreciative of words of encouragement received from several BU staff.
