    <h1> Community Protection Notice Warning (CPW) - Compliance</h1>
    <p>The CPW requires the following remedy:</p>
    <p>You Must not attend or enter any premises which you have been banned from
      by formal letter within the BCP Council Area (Bournemouth, Christchurch and
      Poole). The letter must be issued by someone in authority from those
      premises, BCP Council Officers or Employees of Dorset Police.</p>
    <p>VA has three banning letters with the BCP area. Of these one matches the above criteria. This prohibits VA from a very small area outside a coffee shop VA had used for autism support drop-in meetings. It is the area in which VA had made a SAR verbally to the PCSO. The same PCSO made the malicious CPW referral.</p>
    <p>BCP ASM Team have notified VA that the PCSO will be monitoring compliance and the above is sufficient for the PCSO to identify this area. Since the PCSO has forwarded the SAR, Dorset Police in general can also identify this area due to the SAR being made there and captured on BWV. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is the location stated in Hate Crime ref 55240146701 that VA is the victim of and was investigating.</p>
    <p>VA will respect the authority of BCP ASB Team and avoid unreasonable entry into this area.</p>
