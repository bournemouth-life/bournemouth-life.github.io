    <title>Bournemouth Life - BH Live Safeguarding Improvements</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <h3>Note:</h3>
      The Associate Director of Leisure at BH Live has noted that the policies have been publicised on this website without consent. However no specific objection has been raised. The policies were in fact publicised in response to a <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/safeguarding_policy_of_partner_o">FOI request</a>. This website hosts a <a href="BHLiveSafeguardingCollated.pdf">PDF aggregation</a> of the policy documents already publicised on WhatDoTheyKnow. We have contacted the DSO at BH Live to ask if there are any specific objections to their policy being hosted here and help them explore better ways to make their safeguarding policy publicly available in the future. We continue to offer BH Live our support in making the suggested improvements.
