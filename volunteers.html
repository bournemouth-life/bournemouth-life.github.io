Often I can be found protesting for improved safeguarding and awareness of the needs of the most vulnerable in the community. In particular I am interested in safeguarding and wellbeing of international people who may not be legally defined as vulnerable under current legislation.</td></tr>

Just kidding, I'm here and fully prepared with Dr. Andrew Rogers to accompany you through the difficulties you have been facing, such as academic challenges, cultural adaptation, or personal issues. 
As an international student, I've experienced similar situations, like feeling lonely and isolated. I know it can be tough. But remember, you're not alone in this. At least you've got us!</td><td><img src="images/Marco.png"></td></tr>
