      <center><h1>Neurodiverse Friends Bournemouth</h1></center>
      Just a group of good friends from neurodiverse backgrounds. We reach out to others from similar backgrounds regardless of student status or employment status. We have no office (unless you include Starbucks!). No expenses. No fundraising. Just <a href="https://www.gov.uk/unincorporated-associations"> volunteers</a> and this shockingly poor website! There is no distinction between the befrienders and the befriended. It's time to love again!
      <h2> Homestay Accommodation </h2>
      If you are an international student looking for homestay accommodation, please email andi@bournemouth.life for more info. Our hosts are autism aware and are DBS checked.
      <h2>Raising Autism Awareness and Community Protection</h2>
      Due to my spare time being spent in the community I have little time to create a nice flash website. So I go for more of a simple blog approach.<br>
      
      <h3> 23rd June 2023 - BCP Council acknowledge a proactive approach in handling safeguarding concerns at BH Live. </h3>
      <p>One of our friends has been active in improving the safeguarding culture at BH Live. In a complaint currently being investigated by BCP Council, the
      Leisure Commissioning Manager states "he has been proactive in seeking support to reduce risk to himself and others."</p>
      
      <p>BCP Council are claiming that facts are now difficult to establish due to the staff turnover since 2019. Safeguarding incidents were reported to BCP Council in 2020 to which a representative responded, "I have referred your case to safeguarding however they have confirmed that the situation as described would not constitute a formal safeguarding enquiry and we will therefore be closing the case." The failure to respond to the case at that time has now led to a more complicated investigation because of the time that has since elapsed.</p>
      
      <p>One hopes, then, that the approach taken to safeguarding cases reported to it has improved and that BCP Council are no longer dismissive of cases reported to it.</p>
      
      <p>It took one victim over two years to acquire the safeguarding policy from BH Live. During this time he was given three CPN Warning letters intended to undermine his right to protest. Thankfully his sacrificial determination resulted in BH Live eventually producing the requested policy. It was supplied in many parts which has been collated for them and can be found on this website as a <a href="BHLiveSafeguardingCollated.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>
      
      <h3> 5th May 2023 - The electorate have voted for social justice </h3>
      
      <center><h2> Tories think they're right, the truth-seekers left!</h2></center>
      
      My Friends, a new BCP Council has been voted in. Your votes counted (eventually, after many recounts of East Cliff and Springbourne). Time for truth, time for seeing the most vulnerable supported and not abused and defamed. Keep their campaign literature, highlight what is important to you, and hold them to their promises! Votes won on promises not kept is fraud! Join the party and win for social justice. - A Qureens Park supporter/constituent!!!
      
      <h3> 4th May 2023 - Local elections </h3>
      
      A friend reports spending time with candidates and supporters at two polling stations in his ward. His observations were that only two parties had candidates show up - Greens and Conservatives. There was a real sense for a desire for change and many discussions around corruption under the current leadership of BCP Council. He reports his hope that the needed change will bring needed improvements to supporting and protecting vulnerable adults and those with autism. The man has been denied access to anxiety support and peer support. He has first hand experience of the neglect and further abuse he had suffered after reporting safeguarding incidents to BCP council in 2020. His hopes are that a change of leadership will bring better support for himself and other victims of abuse and neglect in BCP area.
      
      <h3> 3rd May 2023 - Suicide Prevention </h3>
      
      <p>The recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-65423997">suicide of a student at Aberystwyth univeristy</a> prompted an initial survey of students in Bournemouth and Southampton. Previously, there had been a dispute at a university where an autistic man was banned from accessing peer support meetings on campus after he had visited their Faith and Reflection Centre. Leading to his ban, the man had enquired about wellbeing support for an international student who had disclosed suicidal thoughts. There is a need to complement campus provided wellbeing services with other forms of support off campus and accessible to international students.</p>
      
      <p>Two students from Hong Kong and one from PRC have been asked who they would turn to first if they were experiencing a mental health crisis or having suicidal thoughts. All three said they would go to a friend or family member first. Two (the third was not specifically asked) would be unlikely to access wellbeing services. All three confirmed they were made aware of wellbeing services provided by their respective unis. These are very preliminary findings and there is need to conduct a more thorough survey to establish what form off campus support should take.</p>
      
      <p>Prior to conducting the survey we would like you to <a href="mailto:survey@bhpro.life">email us</a> your thoughts and suggestions for survey questions.</p>
