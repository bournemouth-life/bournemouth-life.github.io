      <center><h1>Neurodiverse Friends Bournemouth</h1></center>
      Just a group of good friends from neurodiverse backgrounds. We reach out to others from similar backgrounds regardless of student status or employment status. We have no office (unless you include Starbucks!). No expenses. No fundraising. Just <a href="https://www.gov.uk/unincorporated-associations"> volunteers</a> and this shockingly poor website! There is no distinction between the befrienders and the befriended. It's time to love again!
      <h2>Raising Autism Awareness and Community Protection</h2>
      Due to my spare time being spent in the community I have little time to create a nice flash website. So I go for more of a simple blog approach.<br>
