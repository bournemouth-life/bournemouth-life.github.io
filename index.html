      <center><h2>Neurodiverse Friends Bournemouth</h2></center>
      Note: we cannot currently offer emergency crisis support. If you are in need of urgent support, the National Autistic Society provide a number of <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/contact-us/urgent-help">contact links</a>.<br><br>
      We are a group of good friends from neurodiverse backgrounds with experience in academia. We reach out to others from similar backgrounds regardless of student status or employment status. We have no office (unless you include Starbucks!). No expenses. No fundraising. Just <a href="https://www.gov.uk/unincorporated-associations">volunteers</a> who have experienced some form of mental health illness themselves during their time within academia. There are emerging reports that university provided wellbeing services are inadequate or in some cases simply not accessed by those needing support during a crisis. More info on the <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/where-is-the-line-between-tailoring-and-universality-in-mental-health-support/">WONKHE website</a>.<br><br>
      
      The aim of the friends groups is to spot mental health decline amongst our peers before it declines to crisis point. Just being able to ask someone who is withdrawing if they are OK could save a life.
      <h2><a href="https://chng.it/nYxzfBRK7f">Petition to protect Immigrants and International Students</a></h2>
      During this time of many wars and displacements, there will be many immigrants expected to arrive in the UK. <a href="https://chng.it/nYxzfBRK7f">Please sign the petition</a> to help protect these people and other international adults who are vulnerable on their arrival to a new culture.<br><br>
      Safeguarding and demonstration is a God honouring act. Proverbs 31:8-9 gives a biblical mandate to protect vulnerable groups. ‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.’ Safeguarding is not something we do just to please the government. It is not a tick-box exercise. It is a legitimate and God honouring ministry.

      <h2>Raising Autism Awareness and Community Protection</h2>
      Our supporters spend a lot of time in the community raising awareness and looking out for people who may need support. We engage those working in the public service sector that we meet in the community and discuss topics such as neurodiversity, suicide and bullying. It is hoped that creating a better awareness will protect the most vulnerable in the community.<br>

      <h2> Neurodiversity Week 2024</h2>
      Bournemouth has three universities. Via FOI requests we asked each how many events and stalls they held for Neurodiversity Week 2024.
      <table>
          <tr><th>Question</th><th>AECC</th><th>AUB</th><th>BU</th></tr>
          <tr><td>How many stalls and events were run?</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>Refused</td></tr>
          <tr><td>How many of these were run by Neurodiverse staff?</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>Refused</td></tr>
          <tr><td>How many of these were run by Neurodiverse students?</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>Refused</td></tr>
          <tr><td>If possible, please provide an estimate of how many people attended these events.</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>Refused</td></tr>
      </table>
      AECC responded within just five working days to our request but did not run any Neurodiveristy related events. Arts University Bournemouth (AUB) did not run any events during Neurodiversity Week but have postponed its event for later this year to be run in Disability History Month. Bournemouth University (BU) has refused the request, we have approached then to reconsider. We are aware of at least one event that BU advertised on their website.
