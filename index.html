      We are a group of good friends from neurodiverse backgrounds with experience in academia. We reach out to others from similar backgrounds regardless of student status or employment status. We are not an organisation and have very low expenses, although we do fundraise for other related charities and organisations. We depend solely on our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/unincorporated-associations">volunteers</a> who have experienced some form of mental health illness themselves during their time within academia. There are emerging reports that university provided wellbeing services are inadequate or in some cases simply not accessed by those needing support during a crisis. More info on the <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/where-is-the-line-between-tailoring-and-universality-in-mental-health-support/">WONKHE website</a>.<br><br>
      
      The aim of the friends groups is to spot mental health decline amongst our peers before it reaches crisis point. Just being able to ask someone who is withdrawing if they are OK could save a life.
      
      <h2>Language Exchange</h2>
      Learning a new language is a great way to improve your mental health. Learn with us in a casual and relaxed manner. We currently have volunteers to help you learn basic Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese and English. As with all our activities, this is open to both students and non-students.

      <h2> Events </h2>
      Feel free to join any of the events below. All groups are open to all regardless of student status, nationality or whether you have an autism diagnosis or not.
      <h3> Neurodiverse Academics</h3>
      Most Saturdays at 1pm. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CPPWkjQGBX1PjDmS9">Starbucks, Lansdowne</a>. A peer support group for neurodiverse people in academia or interested in academia.
      <h2> Homestay Accommodation </h2>
      If you are an international student looking for homestay accommodation, please contact us for more info. Our hosts are autism aware and are DBS checked.
      <h2>Raising Autism Awareness and Community Protection</h2>
      Our supporters spend a lot of time in the community raising awareness and looking out for people who may need support. We engage those working in the public service sector that we meet in the community and discuss topics such as neurodiversity, suicide and bullying. It is hoped that creating a better awareness will protect the most vulnerable in the community.
      <h2>Safeguarding & Activism</h2>
      Safeguarding and demonstration is a God honouring act. Proverbs 31:8-9 gives a biblical mandate to protect vulnerable groups. ‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.’ Safeguarding is not something we do just to please the government. It is not a tick-box exercise. It is a legitimate and God honouring ministry.
