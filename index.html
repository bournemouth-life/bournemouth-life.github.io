      <center><h1>Neurodiverse Friends Bournemouth</h1></center>
      Note: we cannot currently offer emergency crisis support. If you are in need of urgent support, the National Autistic Society provide a number of <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/contact-us/urgent-help">contact links</a>.<br><br>
      We are a group of good friends from neurodiverse backgrounds with experience in academia. We reach out to others from similar backgrounds regardless of student status or employment status. We have no office (unless you include Starbucks!). No expenses. No fundraising. Just <a href="https://www.gov.uk/unincorporated-associations">volunteers</a> who have experienced some form of mental health illness themselves during their time within academia. There are emerging reports that university provided wellbeing services are inadequate or in some cases simply not accessed by those needing support during a crisis. More info on the <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/where-is-the-line-between-tailoring-and-universality-in-mental-health-support/">WONKHE website</a>.

      </ul>
      The aim of the friends groups is to spot mental health decline amongst our peers before it declines to crisis point. Just being able to ask someone who is withdrawing if they are OK could save a life.
      <h2><a href="https://chng.it/nYxzfBRK7f">Petition to protect Immigrants and International Students</a></h2>
      During this time of many wars and displacements, there will be many immigrants expected to arrive in the UK. <a href="https://chng.it/nYxzfBRK7f">Please sign the petition</a> to help protect these people and other international adults who are vulnerable on their arrival to a new culture.<br><br>
      Safeguarding and demonstration is a God honouring act. Proverbs 31:8-9 gives a biblical mandate to protect vulnerable groups. ‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.’ Safeguarding is not something we do just to please the government. It is not a tick-box exercise. It is a legitimate and God honouring ministry.
      <h2> Practice speaking English - 学英文口语</h2>
      Our partner group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/practicespeakingenglish/">Practice speaking English</a>, is open to all students who would like to improve their English speaking skills.
      <h2> Homestay Accommodation </h2>
      If you are an international student looking for homestay accommodation, please email andi@bournemouth.life for more info. Our hosts are autism aware and are DBS checked.
      <h2>Raising Autism Awareness and Community Protection</h2>
      Our supporters spend a lot of time in the community raising awareness and looking out for people who may need support. We engage those working in the public service sector that we meet in the community and discuss topics such as neurodiversity, suicide and bullying. It is hoped that creating a better awareness will protect the most vulnerable in the community.<br>
