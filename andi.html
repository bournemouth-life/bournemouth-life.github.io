      <center><h1>Introducing our Social Justice Activist - Andi</h1></center>
      Andi is a Social Justice Activist and a member of the Green Party. His activist person sprung into being in 2011 during his studies when he brought a prayer request to the Chaplaincy of Plymouth University. His prayer was immediately labelled as 'noticeboard prayer' by the coordinating chaplain, an employee of Plymouth University at the time. He brought two prayer requests both of which could be considered as an expression of his desire to seek social justice. The first of these prayers concerned a student who had told him about Chinese students being made to repeat stages of their course whilst native students always passed. The second of these prayers concerned catering staff feeling bullied by the vice-chancellor. Andi reports a stressed relationship with the coordinating chaplain from that time forward. Comments would be made about how he shaved and what colour shirt he wore. Much later we able to identify that Andi was the victim of abuse. Whilst he had a diagnosis of Dyslexia, his Autism was not diagnosed until 2014 when he defended an ASBO for protesting on the university campus.<br><br>
      
      Andi continues to be proactive in safeguarding and autism awareness and recently campaigned for BH Live to publicise their safeguarding policy. Their staff now also undertake awareness training. His protest was protracted and BH Live sought to ban him and others after initial requests for their safeguarding policy were refused. His proactive approach has been recognised by BCP Council.<br><br>
      
      Andi is a member of Bournemouth International Church. Through his ministry there he has served as a safeguarding activist with safeguarding training support given by the United Reformed Church. He effectively communicates safeguarding policy with non-native speakers. Andi was one of the first members of BIC to undertake the safeguarding training offered by the URC. He took the course materials back to the church and encouraged many others to attend a later safeguarding course. Since his involvement, BIC has become a much more safeguarding aware church and now leads the way nationally in supporting our campaign to safeguard international students and immigrants while orienting in the UK.
