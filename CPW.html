    <h2> Executive Summary </h2>
    A pattern of refused, delayed and ignored Subject Acess Requests (SAR) exists across a number of organisations. This page details how Dorset Police, instead of providing the requested data, referred a vulnerable adult with autism to BCP Council ASB Team for a CPN written warning. Of wider concern is the issue of Dorset Police oppressing those expressing their rights to protest and the criminalisation of free speech.
    <h2> Background </h2>
    <p>A Christian and Vulnerable Adult with autism, who we shall name VA (not their real name), was banned from EZ1 (Anonymised) after a director alleged that VA may have attempted to convert Chinese Staff and Students to Christianity. VA had been attending an autism support group that is run within the boundary of EZ1 by DAAS. In November 2022 VA had met a Chinese student that had expressed suicidal thoughts. VA was banned after seeking support and advice at an office in EZ1.</p>
    <p>VA set up an alternative group on Lansdowne campus in various coffee shops but was subsequently banned from EZ2 (Exclusion Zone TBD after grant of permission).</p>
    <p>VA challenged these bans and on 21st March 2025 Dorset Police attended. A disclosure was made during this visit that was relevant to a hate crime that VA is a victim of and that VA was investigating. VA made a Subject Access Request (SAR) to Dorset Police on 10th April 2025 for body worn CCTV, this was not responded to. Instead Dorset Police referred VA to BCP ASB Team. BCP ASB Team produced a Community Protect Notice Warning Letter (CPW) dated 30th May 2025 that was delivered by Dorset Police and CSAS to the home of VA on 10th June 2025.</p>
    <p>VA is a Christian and subject to governing authorities. Whilst the CPW is unfair, VA had aimed to comply and uphold the values of the Christian faith.</p>
    <h2> A Personal Statement from VA </h2>
    <p>Thanks to the support of many people around me my social etiquette has improved considerably following my autism diangnosis. However, I will accept that I am far from perfect. A full disclosure on the three incidents mentioned in the CPW will help myself and my mentors further improve my social etiquette. Denial of access to autism support meetings has hampered progress but I have befriended supportive people in other places such as coffee shops and pubs.</p>
    <p>As a Christian I submit to governing authorities. To this end I am working with BCP ASB Team to first establish the exclusion zones and secondly providing for open monitoring of compliance. This is a mattter of Community Protection and so we will also work together to tackle bullying and toxic culture so that our front-line police and volunteers can feel more confident in Protecting the Community without opression.</p>
    <p>Again, many thanks for the support you have given me and no doubt will continue to give.</p>
    <h2>Significant Updates</h2>

    <h3> 14th July 2025 - Dorset Police not responding. </h3>
    <p> Dorset Police are not cooperating with the enquiries regarding the meaning of the red and blue ink on a map provided by them. </p>
    <p> Dorset Police have also not replied to an email in which VA asked for an update on the SAR made on 10th April 2025.</p>
    <p> Given the lack of cooperation from BCP ASB Team and Dorset Police on the matter, VA feels there is little that can now be done to formulate a valid CPN written warning. VA therefore maintains that they do not accept the warning. Any behaviour identified in disclosures made from SAR responses will be considered by VA and mentoring/accountability sought from autism professionals or church pastors.</p>

    <h3>7th July 2025 - VA working with Dorset Police to propose a valid CPW but BCP ASB Team won't be responding! The type of ASB needing to be remedied is still not disclosed.</h3>

    <p>Dorset Police has shown some cooperation by providing a map relating to one of the exclusion zones. The ASB needing to be remedied has still not been identified. The purpose of a CPW is to allow enough time to deal with the matter, the CPW must identify the conduct. Once a valid CPW can be produced, this can be passed to BCP ASB Team for their review. There is still no response to the SAR made to Dorset Police on 10th April 2025.</p>

    <p>The six months given to remedy the behaviour may have seemed generous but the actual time is much shorter. VA is still waiting for a SAR made on 10th June 2025, the day VA received the CPW letter. Assuming VA has a disclosure by 10th July 2025, VA will have just five months to remedy the behaviour disclosed therein.</p>

    <p>Emails from BCP ASB Team show that they had intended using the six month period as a period of enforcement of exclusion zones rather than allowing VA time to deal with behaviour.</p>

    <p>The CPW remains unaccepted by VA and the BCP ASB Team lead has stated they they won't be responding to futher correspondance ragarding the SAR process or the CPW. They have stated that VA can request a review which VA will do in due course when more disclosure of the ASB is made. We feel that the BCP ASB Team should initiate the review based on the identified inadequacies and non-conformance with legislation.</p>

    <h3>30th June 2025 - CPW not accepted by VA</h3>
    VA has written to BCP ASB Team giving an explanation as to why the CPW is not accepted. BCP ASB Team has confirmed it had outlined the unnaceptable behaviour, however VA feels this should be detailed and specific after seeking legal advice. An outline is inadequate. As the unnaceptable behaviour should have been detailed within the CPW, it is not necessary to wait for the response to a SAR VA had made. The CPW does not state what VA is believed to have done that constitutes ASB. Conduct that has or is likely to cause Harrassment, alarm and distress is the definition of ASB. The broad definition of ASB is given but the specific conduct of VA is not disclosed. The words "Three incidents of Anti-Social Behaviour" appear but none of these three incidents have any disclosure whatsoever - not even a date. VA can not be expected to "stop or remedy the identified behaviour" when none has been identified. Therefore this CPN written warning is not fit for the purpose it defines.

    <h2>Compliance</h2>
    VA had intended to comply with the terms of the CPW but the exact exclusion zones had not been defined. Without these being defined, BCP ASB Team, Dorset Police and VA themselves were not able to manage and track compliance. VA had worked peacefully with BCP ASB Team to establish the Exculsion Zones. These are reported below.
    <h2> Exclusion Zones</h2>
    <h3> EZ1 - Anonymised</h3>
    VA was excluded from EZ1 on 18th November 2022.
    <h4> Boundary of Exclusion Zone</h4>
    No person in authority at EZ1 has indicated any support for the CPW and no map has been provided.
    <h4> Reason for Exclusion</h4>
    In the letter dated 18th November 2022 an ex-director writes "It has come to my attention that you have been attending [REDACTED], uninvited, with the apparent purpose of befriending Chinese students and staff. My understanding is that you may be motivated to converting them to Christianity or at least offering your view of the benefits of this religion."
    <h4> Alleged ASB from CPW</h4>
    None yet specified.
    <h4> Other Information</h4>
    VA cannot attend DAAS autsim support meetings as these are held within the boundary of the exclusion zone. Attempts to negotiate access to autism support were denied. VA established a separate group in Lansdowne as a means of peaceful resolution.
    The above mentioned director took early retirement and another officer resigned after enquiries were made about discrimination against neurodiverse people.
    
    <h3> EZ2 - Anonymised </h3>
    Exclusion Zone TBD after grant of permission from director or person in authority at exclusion zone.
    <h4> Boundary of Exclusion Zone</h4>
    VA has a fairly certain understanding of the boundary due to the small size of the zone. VA has contacted the director for a boundary plan to assist BCP ASB Team is compliance tracking. The director has not indicated any support for the CPW. Exclusion zone outlined on a map provided by Dorset Police more than a month after the CPW was written.
    <h4> Reason for Exclusion</h4>
    Dorset Police claim that the director of EZ2 was told by [REDACTED, EZ1] that VA was subject to a court injunction.
    <h4> Alleged ASB from CPW</h4>
    None yet specified.
    <h4> Other Information</h4>
    VA is not subject to any court injuction. Malicious and false accusation was made based on the misuse of information given in the autism diagnosis report VA had provided in confidence to an office at EZ1. The organisation in authority of EZ2 may wish to remain anonymous as it effectively exposed the corruption of [REDACTED, EZ1] and possibly Dorset Police by basing its ban on a false and malicious allegation. The reason had not been stated in its official banning letter. A respected PCSO had enquired of this and reported this verbally to VA. There has been no mention of this organisation in any of the communications VA has had with the ASB Team concerning the CPW.
