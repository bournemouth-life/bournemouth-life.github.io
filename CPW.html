    <title>Community Protection Notice Warning (CPW)</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>A Christian and Vulnerable Adult with autism, who we shall name VA (not their real name), was banned from EZ1 (BU Talbot campus) after Bournmouth University (BU) alleged that VA may have attempted to convert Chinese Staff and Students to Christianity. VA had been attending an autism support group that is run on BU Talbot campus by DAAS. In November 2022 VA had met a Chinese student that had expressed suicidal thoughts. VA was banned after seeking support and advice at the Faith and Reflection centre.</p>
    <p>VA set up an alternative group on Lansdowne campus in various coffee shops but was subsequently banned from EZ2 (Exclusion Zone TBD after grant of permission).</p>
    <p>VA challenged these bans and on 21st March 2025 Dorset Police attended. A disclosure was made during this visit that was relevant to a hate crime that VA is a victim of and that VA was investigating. VA made a Subject Access Request (SAR) to Dorset Police on 10th April 2025 for body worn CCTV, this was not responded to. Instead Dorset Police referred VA to BCP ASB Team. BCP ASB Team produced a Community Protect Notice Warning Letter (CPW) dated 30th May 2025 that was delivered by Dorset Police and CSAS to the home of VA on 10th June 2025.</p>
    <p>VA is a Christian and subject to governing authorities. Whilst the CPW is unfair, VA aims to comply and uphold the values of the Christian faith.</p>
    <h1>Compliance</h1>
    VA intents to comply with the terms of the CPW but the exact exclusion zones have not been defined. Without these being defined, BCP ASB Team, Dorset Police and VA themselves cannot manage and track compliance. VA is working peacefully with BCP ASB Team to establish the Exculsion Zones. These will be reported below and updated as they are resolved and finalised.
    <h1> Exclusion Zones</h1>
    <h2> EZ1 - BU Talbot Campus</h2>
    VA was excluded from the BU Talbot campus on 18th November 2022.
    <h3> Boundary of Exclusion Zone</h3>
    This is being clarified and BCP ASB Team have asked BU for this. Currently assumed to be the area inside the road loop that U1 and U3 buses make around Talbot campus, excluding the buses, bus stops and roads (inclusive of pavements) themselves.
    <h3> Reason for Exclusion</h3>
    The BU (ex) Director of Students writes "It has come to my attention that you have been attending campus, uninvited, with the apparent purpose of befriending Chinese students and staff. My understanding is that you may be motivated to converting them to Christianity or at least offering your view of the benefits of this religion."
    <h3> Other Information</h3>
    VA cannot attend DAAS autsim support meetings as these are held within the boundary of the exclusion zone. Attempts to negotiate access to autism support were denied. VA established a separate group in Lansdowne as a means of peaceful resolution.
    The Director of Students took early retiremnt and the COO resigned after enquiries were made about discrimination against neurodiverse people.
    
    <h2> EZ2 - TBD </h2>
    Exclusion Zone TBD after grant of permission from director or person in authority at exclusion zone.
    <h3> Boundary of Exclusion Zone</h3>
    VA has a fairly certain understanding of the boundary due to the small size of the zone. VA has contacted the director for a boundary plan to assist BCP ASB Team is compliance tracking.
    <h3> Reason for Exclusion</h3>
    Dorset Police claim that the director of TBD was told by BU that VA was subject to a court injunction.
    <h3> Other Information</h3>
    VA is not subject to any court injuction. Malicious and false accusation was made based on the misuse of information given in the autism diagnosis report VA had provided in confidence to BU Faith and Reflection.
    <h1> Further Information</h1>
    Due to the nature of these events and the need to protect vulnerable persons not all the details can be published here. VA regularly attends BINF meetings and is open to questions you may have.
