    <h2> Background </h2>
    <p>A Christian and Vulnerable Adult with autism, who we shall name VA (not their real name), was banned from EZ1 (Anonymised) after a director alleged that VA may have attempted to convert Chinese Staff and Students to Christianity. VA had been attending an autism support group that is run within the boundary of EZ1 by DAAS. In November 2022 VA had met a Chinese student that had expressed suicidal thoughts. VA was banned after seeking support and advice at an office in EZ1.</p>
    <p>VA set up an alternative group on Lansdowne campus in various coffee shops but was subsequently banned from EZ2 (Exclusion Zone TBD after grant of permission).</p>
    <p>VA challenged these bans and on 21st March 2025 Dorset Police attended. A disclosure was made during this visit that was relevant to a hate crime that VA is a victim of and that VA was investigating. VA made a Subject Access Request (SAR) to Dorset Police on 10th April 2025 for body worn CCTV, this was not responded to. Instead Dorset Police referred VA to BCP ASB Team. BCP ASB Team produced a Community Protect Notice Warning Letter (CPW) dated 30th May 2025 that was delivered by Dorset Police and CSAS to the home of VA on 10th June 2025.</p>
    <p>VA is a Christian and subject to governing authorities. Whilst the CPW is unfair, VA aims to comply and uphold the values of the Christian faith.</p>
    <h2> A Personal Statement from VA </h2>
    <p>Thanks to the support of many people around me my social etiquette has improved considerably following my autism diangnosis. However, I will accept that I am far from perfect. A full disclosure on the three incidents mentioned in the CPW will help myself and my mentors further improve my social etiquette. Denial of access to autism support meetings has hampered progress but I have befriended supportive people in other places such as coffee shops and pubs.</p>
    <p>As a Christian I submit to governing authorities. To this end I am working with BCP ASB Team to first establish the exclusion zones and secondly providing for open monitoring of compliance. This is a mattter of Community Protection and so we will also work together to tackle bullying and toxic culture so that our front-line police and volunteers can feel more confident in Protecting the Community without opression.</p>
    <p>Again, many thanks for the support you have given me and no doubt will continue to give.</p>
    <h2>Compliance</h2>
    VA had intended to comply with the terms of the CPW but the exact exclusion zones had not been defined. Without these being defined, BCP ASB Team, Dorset Police and VA themselves were not able to manage and track compliance. VA had worked peacefully with BCP ASB Team to establish the Exculsion Zones. These are reported below.
    <h2> Exclusion Zones</h2>
    <h3> EZ1 - Anonymised</h3>
    VA was excluded from EZ1 on 18th November 2022.
    <h4> Boundary of Exclusion Zone</h4>
    No person in authority at EZ1 has indicated any support for the CPW and no map has been provided.
    <h4> Reason for Exclusion</h4>
    An ex-director writes "It has come to my attention that you have been attending [REDACTED], uninvited, with the apparent purpose of befriending Chinese students and staff. My understanding is that you may be motivated to converting them to Christianity or at least offering your view of the benefits of this religion."
    <h4> Other Information</h4>
    VA cannot attend DAAS autsim support meetings as these are held within the boundary of the exclusion zone. Attempts to negotiate access to autism support were denied. VA established a separate group in Lansdowne as a means of peaceful resolution.
    The above mentioned director took early retirement and another officer resigned after enquiries were made about discrimination against neurodiverse people.
    
    <h3> EZ2 - Anonymised </h3>
    Exclusion Zone TBD after grant of permission from director or person in authority at exclusion zone.
    <h4> Boundary of Exclusion Zone</h4>
    VA has a fairly certain understanding of the boundary due to the small size of the zone. VA has contacted the director for a boundary plan to assist BCP ASB Team is compliance tracking. The director has not indicated any support for the CPW and no map has been provided.
    <h4> Reason for Exclusion</h4>
    Dorset Police claim that the director of EZ2 was told by [REDACTED, EZ1] that VA was subject to a court injunction.
    <h4> Other Information</h4>
    VA is not subject to any court injuction. Malicious and false accusation was made based on the misuse of information given in the autism diagnosis report VA had provided in confidence to an office at EZ1. The organisation in authority of EZ2 may wish to remain anonymous as it effectively exposed the corruption of [REDACTED, EZ1] and possibly Dorset Police by basing its ban on a false and malicious allegation. The reason had not been stated in its official banning letter. A respected PCSO had enquired of this and reported this verbally to VA. There has been no mention of this organisation in any of the communications VA has had with the ASB Team concerning the CPW.
