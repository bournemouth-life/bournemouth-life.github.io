      <h2>25th November 2022 - Are PCSOs misunderstood?</h2>
      Following some hateful comments that I found on facebook targeted towards PCSOs I decided to meet them just to hear about their jobs. When I entered the room two PCSOs were sat near a table with open gesture. I approached them and they asked how they might help me. I told them that I didn't come for them to help me and that I wanted to find our more about them and their job. I opened the conversation with the question, "As an autistic person in the community how can I assist police when in the community?" What has this to do with autism awareness campaigning you might ask. Autistic people in the community share some of the same negative issues that PCSOs face:<br>
      <br>
      <li>Misunderstood</li>
      <li>Misrepresented (often malicious or hateful)</li>
      <br>
      Identifying that we have these things in common allowed me to share my experiences as well as listening to theirs. This helped me gain a much better understanding of the good work PCSOs do in the community and helped them understand a little more about working with autistic people in the community. From the conversation I took away three key points about their job:<br>
      <br>
      <li>Tackling Anti-social Behaviour (ASB seems to be an accepted acronym)</li>
      <li>Making a visible presence on the street.</li>
      <li>Helping people who are struggling. (not often spoken about by people on facebook)</li>
      <br>
      We agreed that people were to eager to express hatred in their online comments and very slow to offer praise or any expression of love. This is true of both facebook comments and those on the Bournemouth Echo site. We discussed a few examples.
      They already had a good autism awareness and invited me to apply as a volunteer in the force to extend this further. They know to look in your wallet in an emergency where you may be unconscious to find emergency information and your Autism Alert card.<br>
      I left feeling that the conversion had benefited them as well as those in the community on the autistic spectrum.
